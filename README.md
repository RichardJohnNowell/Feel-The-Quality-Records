    Feel The Quality Records (FTQR) is an independent music label from Bristol.
    </strong></p>
</div>
<br>
FTQR specialises in electronic music with many influences including triphop, reggae and beats & rhymes. We have also
recorded and released rock-orientated tunes and collaborated with musicians in France and Switzerland.

## Introduction.

Feel the Quality Records (FTQR) was a record label that existed between 2005
and 2013. However, its outgoings exceeded its incomings and so it went bust.
Resurrecting it for this project seemed appropriate.

The website will feature two merchandise pages for t-shirts and cds.
T-shirts are one of the ways bands can get income - they are cheap
to produce and also act as publicity. As for selling cds, this is an option but 
not one that many will take up. Music has essentially become free with digital 
formats so easy to share. While people can collect royalties from say YouTube 
or Soundcloud, artistes need a lot of plays to get worthwhile sums. At the same 
time, musicians that have never relased a cd or 12" get a million plays
on YouTube and Spotify and everything is rosy!

Playing live was never going to make the average local band rich
but there were plenty of venues and free beer - a good excuse to form
a band. This now not the case with small venues closing. Playing
live is about promoting music and getting songs up together to
record. So this website encourages people to listen to the music
provided and the merchandise pages encourages viewers
to help the musicians and buy a product.
